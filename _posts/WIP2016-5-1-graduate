So I graduated from college last Saturday, which is kind of crazy. I mean it felt like just yesterday that I stepped into my first lecture freshman year, or finished a summer of LT at New Life, or moved into my room in Nagoya. But here I am, a Michigan engineering alum, ready to take on the world. So what now? What do I want to do with myself now that I'm not bogged down by group projects and bugs in my code? Well that means I get to pursue 

Since college did a great job of sucking up all my time, I didn't do as much art and other side hobbies as I wanted to. I made a bunch of art-related goals at the beginning of the year, but have since failed to keep going for them. As an attempt to remedy this, I bought a passion planner midway through the past semester, since I'd heard great things about it and wanted to give it a shot. Well surprise surprise, I still failed. I liked being able to write out my daily schedules and view them hour by hour like on google calendar, something that other planners I'd used in the past didn't have. But I still didn't end up drawing or blogging and such. I realized that it was probably because I didn't set aside time in my schedule for it, since all I set aside time for was school. Doodling in the margins was as much art as I got to do. 

However, towards the end of the semester when senioritis was in full force, I decided I needed to change my life habits. I made a list of things I'd always wanted to do, and sat down to plan them out. The main ones are
1. Continuing this blog
2. Creating more colored drawings and paintings, either digital, watercolor, or acrylic
Now that I've graduated, I'll actually have time to do these things! After my finals, I took an evening to figure out how to re-colorcode my life since it's no longer guided by classes. I decided that for balance, the main things in my life will be
- art - my art projects
- work - because i'm gonna be a real adult with a real job
- exercise - staying healthy
- social - hanging out with people
- events - like travel and whatnot
- God - prayer, reading the Bible, spending time with God
- misc - because you always need a misc category

The nice thing about planning my time like this is that theoretically, if there's an even color spread in my planner, then my life will be balanced. So the key component is actually doing what I plan to do.
