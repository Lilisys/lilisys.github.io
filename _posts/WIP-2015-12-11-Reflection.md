Time flies like an arrow. It feels like I just moved in yesterday, but here I am, with about a week left. As my time in Japan draws to a close, I thought I'd sit back and reflect on some of the goals I set for myself, both inside and outside the classroom. 

Before coming to Japan, I wanted to set goals for myself relating to cs, art, and music. Since I'd be spending a semester away from cs, my skills were definitely going to get rusty so I planned on keeping up with a side project, namely this blog. I mad sure to get it all set up before coming to Japan, that way I could just post away. I wanted this project to be a way for me to express myself and share my thoughts with others. During the summer, I felt like God was hinting that I should be a teacher in some way, not necessarily in a formal classroom but I could lead others through
