I've enjoyed soy milk ever since I was a child. Part of the reason is that whenever I was in Taiwan, regular milk disagreed with my insides so I just got used to drinking soy milk instead. The milk in Japan is similar, so I've just continued drinking soy milk. What I discovered early on one day at the supermarket was that here, Kikkoman sells little juice-box-sized soy milks in various flavors. Of course I decided to make a point to try and rank them all. 

When I try a flavor, I give it a score of some number between 1 and 10 inclusive (so like [1, 10]). The ranking system is somewhat arbitrary, and somewhat relative to other flavors. In general, 3-5 means I wouldn't choose to drink them again save for life-threatening circumstances while 6 and above means yeah I'd buy it again. The 9's contain some of my favorite flavors while a 1 or 2 means I hope to God I'll never have to drink this again. I saved the elusive 10 for flavor(s) that really just took the cake and went above and beyond anything I could ever hope for. 

Additionally, flavors are also ranked a bit by how they varied from my expectations. Things around 3-5 tend to be flavors I thought would be good but ended up tasting kind of bad, things around 6-7 contain flavors I thought would be bad but were ok, and things around 8-10 are flavors that were better or just as good as I expected. But again, this is super arbitrary and not necessarily a set rule. 

Here's what I have so far. I'll keep updating this as I find more flavors to try. 

| Flavor                            | Score         | Comments  |
| :-------------------------------- |:-------------:| --------- |
| 普通  (Plain)                     | 9 |  | 
| バナナ (Banana)                   | 7 | | 
| ごま (Black Sesame)               | 4 |I thought this was going to be good, but then it wasn't, which surprised me since black sesame usually tastes pretty good.|
|あづき (Red Bean)                  | 6 ||
|チーズケーキ (Cheesecake)          | 2 |I knew this was going to be a weird flavor going in. It had a lot of potential since they could make it creamy and whatnot, but it just ended up being super sour. I drank a few sips then dumped the rest. |
| アボカド (Avocado)                | 9 |Now this flavor was quite the dark horse. I thought it would be awful going in, but it's surprisingly delicious. The avocado flavor is very light and the drink is just sweet and creamy. I buy this pretty much every time I see it at the store. |
|ココア  (Cocoa)                    | 8 ||
|麦芽 (Malt)                        | 8 ||
|抹茶 (Matcha)                      | 9 | |
|紅茶 (Koucha)                      | 9 ||
|焼き芋  (Sweet Potato)             | 7 ||
|無調整  (Sugar Free)               | 1 |Yeah I thought you couldn't really go wrong with plain, but this was God awful. Even worse than cheesecake, which is hard to believe. This doesn't even taste like tofu, I really have no idea how I got through the big carton of this.|
|マロン  (Chestnut)                 | 9 ||
|フルーツミックス (Fruits Mix)      | 4 |I thought this was going to be sweet and fruity, but it was mostly just sour. Would not recommend.|
|梅  (Plum)                         | 6 |On the other hand, I thought this was going to be sour and gross but it was actually decent. |
|いちご  (Strawberry)               | 5 |I figured you coudln't go wrong with strawberry but nope. This wasn't your generic strawberry milk flavor, but rather that plus a bunch of sourness.|
|ジンジャーエール (Ginger Ale)      | 6 |Thought it was going to be terrible, but it wasn't. It was more sour than I'd prefer, but not so much that I regretted everything upon consumption|
|麦芽コーヒー (Malt + Coffee)       | 9 ||
|白桃 (Peach)                       | 10|Peach. |
