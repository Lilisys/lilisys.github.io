I've enjoyed soy milk ever since I was a child. Part of the reason is that whenever I was in Taiwan, regular milk disagreed with my insides so I just got used to drinking soy milk instead. The milk in Japan is similar, so I've just continued drinking soy milk. What I discovered early on one day at the supermarket was that here, Kikkoman sells little juice-box-sized soy milks in various flavors. Of course I decided to make a point to try and rank them all. 

When I try a flavor, I give it a score of some number between 1 and 10 inclusive (so like [1, 10]). The ranking system is somewhat arbitrary, and somewhat relative to other flavors. In general, 3-5 means I wouldn't choose to drink them again save for life-threatening circumstances while 6 and above means yeah I'd buy it again. The 9's contain some of my favorite flavors while a 1 or 2 means I hope to God I'll never have to drink this again. I saved the elusive 10 for flavor(s) that really just took the cake and went above and beyond anything I could ever hope for. 

Additionally, flavors are also ranked a bit by how they varied from my expectations. Things around 3-5 tend to be flavors I thought would be good but ended up tasting kind of bad, things around 6-7 contain flavors I thought would be bad but were ok, and things around 8-10 are flavors that were better or just as good as I expected. But again, this is super arbitrary and not necessarily a set rule. 

Here's what I have so far. I'll keep updating this as I find more flavors to try.
