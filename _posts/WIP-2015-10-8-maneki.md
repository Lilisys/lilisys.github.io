A few weeks ago, I went with a few friends to a 招き猫祭り (Maneki Neko Matsuri), or Lucky Cat Festival. The lucky cat is a figurine of this beckoning cat is often placed at the front of shops to welcome customers. A raised right paw brings in money and luck while a raised left paw brings in people and customers. This festival took place in Seto, a city that was about an hour northeast of Nagoya by train that's mainly known for its pottery.
