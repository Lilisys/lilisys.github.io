Today was just one of those days. 

Starting yesterday, classes began for the rest of the students at Nanzan. I hadn't realized this, so after finally finishing 3 hours of a tough class, I had to race to the cafeteria or conbini in order to get lunch. By the time I got there, most of the seats in the cafeteria were taken, so I settled for the conbini. However, the line was crazy and food was quickly running out. I managed to get some stuff, but was feeling some mild social anxiety due to the hoardes of people surrounding me (yeah the introvert in me was like BYE). One of my friends was smart and brought lunch, so I promised myself I'd pack lunch for today. There was a spare bento box at the house and I could fill it with rice, eggs, spinach, and some main dish. I planned on getting up at 7 to prep so I set my alarm clock accordingly.

Little did I realize, I changed the time but didn't turn the clock on. So this morning, I kept waking up and looking at the clock thinking "yeah, I still have a few more minutes" and going back to sleep. When it looked like 7:15, I was like "ahh, a bit later than I wanted but still doable" so I went downstairs to cook. I walk into the kitchen and all my roommates are there, pretty much ready to go. I check the time and it's 8:15, not 7:15. Welp so much for lunch. I quickly ran upstairs and got ready in like 5-10 minutes, grabbed some bread and ran out the door at around 8:30. 

The commute was also a struggle. In Japan walking and eating/drinking isn't really socially accceptable, but I was like "whatever. we doing this" so I ate my bread as we walked to the station. The bread was one of those cream cornet things so as I ate the cream slowly got all over my hands. Nothing terrible happened, it was just a mess. When we got to the station, I was gesturing wildly while talking about something to my roommates, and my commuter pass flew out of my hand. Yeah good thing I saw it otherwise transportation would've been much harder. 

The rest of the day was just filled with little inconveniences. I got to class like 2 minutes before the bell rang, had to partner up with people on the other side of the room, I was the last person out of my hanga (wood block prining) class because I changed my design halfway through. The one redeeming thing was that I accidentally did today's homework yesterday, so I had a free evening. Yeah I'm glad we're done for the day (and I'm setting my alarm clock now).
