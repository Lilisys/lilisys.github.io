A few weeks ago, I went with a few friends to a 招き猫祭り (Maneki Neko Matsuri), or Lucky Cat Festival. The lucky cat is a figurine of this beckoning cat is often placed at the front of shops to welcome customers. A raised right paw brings in money and luck while a raised left paw brings in people and customers. This festival took place in Seto, a city that was about an hour northeast of Nagoya by train that's mainly known for its pottery. It's pretty rural, which means the locals don't often see a lot of foreigners. 

And of course, my friends and I are all foreigners. 

This resulted us being treated sort of like celebrities. Countless times throughtout the day, my friends and I would be wandering around, and some elderly folks would ask me if they could photograph my friends, who had gotten their faces painted because it was free and would fit the cat theme of the festival. Out of my group of friends I was the only asian, which meant that the elderly folk only talked to me. They didn't bother asking my friends directly if they'd mind being photographed, they only asked me. It was pretty funny for all of us.
