I've been here for 4 days but it feels like it's been much longer than that. It's great to be back in Japan! I've been jetlagged so I've seen several sunrises that look something like this:

I will add more later!

EDIT: Adding stuff retrospectively 

Ok I meant to write a bit about what my living situation has been like and traveling and whatnot. So here goes:

The place in which I'm living is called Rainbow House. It's a "dormitory" in which 6 girls, 1 Japanese and 5 international reside. I put dormitory in quotes beause it's more like a co-op styled apartment since we all have single rooms, cook for ourselves, and must do weekly chores. The landlady who lives next door takes care of us, and she's basically a host mom. She's been driving us to places such as the grocery store and the distrcit ward office, and she also buys shared necessities such as toilet paper and saran wrap for us. The other day she invited us over to have dinner at her place! It will be challenging for me to live with 5 other people, but overall I think I'm going to enjoy it.
