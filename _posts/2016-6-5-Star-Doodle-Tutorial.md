It's been a while since I last posted! I haven't really posted a tutorial yet, so today's post will be just that - a how-to on my method of doodling stars! Five-pointed stars are my aesthetic, so several years ago I doodled them all over my (and my friends') arms and got pretty decent at it. They look something like this:

You can draw them in a block, in a swirl, on a card, etc. So here we go!

You will need:

- a writing utensil (I recommend pen)
- something to write on (Paper is a good choice, I sometimes use my hand but I'm not going to endorse that)

Process:
The first 7 steps go over drawing an outline star. This pattern is composed of hollow stars and filled stars in varying sizes.

1. Start with a little caret (this thing ^)
![Step 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/starTut/step1.jpg)
2. Draw horizontal lines to the right and left of the caret, making sure to angle them slightly downwards
![Step 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/starTut/step2.jpg)
3. Complete the angle from the left line, eyeballing it to make sure it's about the same angle as the initial caret
![Step 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/starTut/step3.jpg)
4. Draw a line coming off of the angle from 3. This line should be mostly parallel to the left line in the original caret
![Step 4]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/starTut/step4.jpg)
5. Draw in two lines, the first connecting to the line from 4 and the second connecting to the rigt line from 2. These two should be mostly parallel
![Step 5]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/starTut/step5.jpg)
6. Draw the final caret, making sure the lines are parallel to the lines from 3 and 1 right
![Step 6]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/starTut/step6.jpg)
7. Thicken each line to hide any mistakes and fix any odd angles.

A filled star is much easier to draw. To make one, just draw your standard 5 cornered star and fill it in. During the fill-in step, you can fix any short sides or weird angles! I did in my example:
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
    ![Fill 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/starTut/fill1.jpg)
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
    ![Fill 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/starTut/fill2.jpg)
  </div>
</div>

The next steps describe pattern construction. The basic idea is to:
1. start with a large hollow star, add a small filled star to the side
![Pattern 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/starTut/pattern1.jpg)
2. then add in a medium sized star of either filling somewhat between them. 
![Pattern 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/starTut/pattern2.jpg)
3. From there, continue drawing stars of varying size, alternating the filling and making sure that adjacent stars of the same size have opposite filling. 
![Pattern 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/starTut/pattern3.jpg)

This is what it might look like:

So hopefully this was easy to follow and you learned something. Feel free to contact me if you want to give any feedback or if you wanna show me what you drew!
