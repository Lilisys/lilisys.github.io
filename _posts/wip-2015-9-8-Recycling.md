The garbage and recycling system here is intense.

When we first got here, the landlady explained the system to us. There are separate bins for all the things you can recycle - paper packaging, PET bottles, cans, plastic packaging. But there are also bins for burnable waste, non-burnable waste, and magazines/newspapers. You take specific items out onto the street corner a few days a week, and on the second Tuedsay of each month (today) you take out all the recycling to this designated spot.
